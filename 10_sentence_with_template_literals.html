    <!-- 
    In JavaScript, template literals are a way to create strings that can include variables or expressions directly inside them, without having to use + for concatenation.

    They are enclosed by backticks ` instead of regular quotes (' or ").

    Key Features:
    - Embed variables using ${variable}.
    - Embed expressions using ${expression}.
    - Can span multiple lines easily.

        let name = "Mehedi"; 
        let age = 25; 

        console.log(`My name is ${name} and I'm ${age} years old.`);
