    <!-- 
    The rules for a leap year are:

    1) A year is a leap year if it is evenly divisible by 4 (year % 4 === 0).
    
    2) EXCEPT if it is also evenly divisible by 100 (year % 100 === 0), then it is NOT a leap year (e.g., 1900, 2100).

    3) UNLESS it is also evenly divisible by 400 (year % 400 === 0), then it IS a leap year (e.g., 2000, 2400).

    We can translate these three rules into one concise conditional statement using the Logical AND (&&) and Logical OR (||) operators.

    <script>
        let year = 2025; 

        if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0)) {
            console.log(`'${year}' is a leap year.`)
        } else {
            console.log(`'${year}' NOT a leap year.`)
        }
